This program is designed to practice queues and priority queues, creating a simulation of an escape room.
The players are moved from the lobby into the waiting room queue before playing. After playing, players are sorted
into a results queue by their overall score and prints them out at the end. Also implements hash function to 
"randomly" generate the player's scores. Priority Queue class is homebrew and not part of Java Collections.
