This Program is designed to simulate a game of pinball. It takes the input from a file 
of pinball target objects and creates a matrix with dimensions indicated by the first
two numbers of the file. Then, after displaying the "playing field", it reads from a 
second file, indicating locations where the ball is at. If the ball lands on a location
where a target is, it increments the hits. It displays every target hit in a list and 
then compares all of the target's hit numbers to sort them in the overridden compareTo
method
