This program will read from several text files and create a List relative to its information.
The list of slots will use both numbers on the text line to initialize a Slot object to be
stored in the ArrayList or Queue. Those lists are given iterators which are sent to a 2D array,
iterating through them and putting every character in its corresponding location noted by the
slot object. The program then prints out every value in the array, with blank spaces being 
represented by an underscore character.
